# OBJECTIVE HEROES

This awesome Frontend was built with React. 

## Short Presentation
 This website was developed in accordance with the test that OBJECTIVE Company has developed.

To be honest, my biggest challenge was to understand the API, but after some time reading the docs, it allows me to develop the website as I wish. 

## Dependencies

So let's start

Please first, make sure you have the NodeJs installed in your pc and I recommend you to install the "yarn" too. You can use "npm" instead and will work, but still, I recommend "yarn".

#### NodeJs -> https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating
#### Yarn -> https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install


## Installation

After you make sure you have NodeJs on your computer: 
1 - git clone "https://github.com/MayconnW/agap2it_front.git";

2 - Copy the "env.example" file as ".env". At the moment there are just two environment variables:  
  - NODE_ENV -> This one is to say if you are running the app in a development or production mode. If you are not sure, just let it "development".
  - REACT_APP_API_HOST -> This one is really important, so pay double attention here. Write the backend address here as the example inside the file.

3 - Then open the terminal inside the directory and run the command "yarn". This will install all the dependencies.

4 - Inside the directory yet, now run the command "yarn start". This will play the server in the 3000 port.

5 - Open your favorite browser and go to "http://localhost:3000" and have fun. :)

## Demo

You can see the website running here -> https://objective-heroes.herokuapp.com

This Website is deployed on Heroku. So when you access the page first time, maybe the server will be sleeping, and it can take some seconds to wake up. 


## Future
Soon I'll create a docker image with this server.
